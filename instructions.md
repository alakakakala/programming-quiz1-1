# Instructions
This is your quiz for the programming section of this class. You will have two programming problems to solve. The first problem is a debugging problem. You are given a program, and your job is to use debugging strategies to find and fix all of the errors. The second problem is a small program you need to make.

You can work with your classmates for this quiz, but it is not required. I recommend small groups of about 2-4 people. Talk with each other and discuss what needs to be done and what information from class applies to the problems. Go through trial and error together when testing out the different problems.

To turn in the quiz, You can submit the github repository link that contains your two completed quiz files. If you aren't using github, you can submit the two Files directly to this assignment: one file for each question. Everyone needs to leave a comment at the top of each python file with their own name and the names of the people they worked with. See the debugging file in question 1 for an example of how to format this. 

## The Quiz:

1. Download this file Download this fileand open it in a code editor of your choice. There are 10 errors to fix

2. Make the following program: Make a python program that asks the user if they want to do an addition or a subtraction program. Then ask the user what two numbers they want to add or subtract. If the user wants to do an addition problem, add the two numbers together and print out the results. If the user wants to do a subtraction problem, subtract the two numbers and print the results. Extra credit for the people who make the addition and subtraction into two separate functions.
